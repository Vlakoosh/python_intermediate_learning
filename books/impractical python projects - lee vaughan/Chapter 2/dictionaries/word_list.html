The link below references an alphabetized list of English words produced
from a number of texts available free on the net.

Since the
sources
were ASCII, the result is ASCII.  The programs used to produce this were
all standard 
<a href="routledge/unix.html">Unix</a> 
<a href="routledge/regex.html">tools</a>,
including <font size=+2><tt>ex, sed,
awk</tt></font>, and <font size=+2><tt>sort</tt></font>.

<p>

The word list itself contains <b>69,903</b> words, and takes up
<b>665,681</b> bytes (that's about two-thirds of a megabyte).  There are
also 69,903 lines in the file, since each word is on a line by itself.
I.e, the file (which is called <i> wordlist </i>)
is big and long, and so are most of the words in it. This in turn means
that
many if not most of the words are rare, obsolete, or simply weird.  
Furthermore, the entire file is in lower case, including all the proper
names.
However, 
you can look up the strange words at 
<a href="http://narp.oed.com/patroget.html">1911
version of Roget's
Thesaurus</a>,

I made this list from these sources as an exercise in applying Unix tools,
and as something
to give my students something to play with.  That's all it is.
It may be useful to you, which is why I put it here.  Or it may not.

You can do whatever you like with it; it's <b>your</b> language, after
all. &#160;<tt> </tt>  For instance, 

if you were using <a href="routledge/unix.html">Unix</a> 
(or 
<a href="http://www.linux.org/">Linux</a>),

and you were curious about the English words that 

ended in
<i>-ically</i>,
or the ones that started with 
<i>antid-</i>,
then

the
<font size=+2><tt>
egrep
</tt></font> 
(or
<font size=+2><tt>
grep</tt></font>)
commands

<ul>
<dd><li>
<font size=+2><tt>
<b>grep 'ical$' wordlist | less </b>
</tt></font>

<dd><li>
<font size=+2><tt>
<b>grep '^antid' wordlist | less </b>
</tt></font>
</ul>

would present them to you instantly in the
<b>
<a href="http://www.gnu.org">gnu</a>
</b>file
viewer
<font size=+2><tt>
less</tt></font>
<dd>(or if you preferred, 
in the
Unix standard viewer
<font size=+2><tt>
more</tt></font>,
 instead
of
<font size=+2><tt>
less</tt></font>).

<p>
To save this list on your disk, go to the "File" menu of your Web browser
after it's done downloading and you've looked at it
all you want, and choose <font size=+1><b>Save As</b></font>.  Then you
can move the file
<font size=+2><tt>
wordlist</tt></font> to
wherever you'd like.
